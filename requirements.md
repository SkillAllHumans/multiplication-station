### Overview
We want to create a simple page that quizzes the user on the multiplication tables from 1x1 to ~~12x12.~~ 10x10.
	
### Statement of Functionality
This page will be a simple, clean interface that focuses on multiplication problems on both mobile and desktop browsers. Users can quickly click through problems, or go more slowly as their ability dictates.

Users may select their factors to determine which range of problems are practiced. For example factors 1, 2, and 3 would show the problems of 1x1 through 3x10.
	
### Performance Requirements
The page will be quick to load and to produce new problems. The page will not consume a lot of memory or lag with unnecessary content. The user will see immediately whether they solved the problem correctly or not.
	
### Usability Requirements
The page will be designed to be intuitive and simple to use, with the mode of interaction being clicks/taps for the basic page.

### Out of Scope
Other mathematical operations.
